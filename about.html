<p>hi i'm <a href="http://www.gaberaines.info">gabe</a>, and i made this thing. sun castle is a long-term project of mine to create an audio map of an imaginary castle. this is my latest attempt to organize some of the recordings i've made into a cohesive whole.</p> 

<p>one idea i'm trying to explore with this site is that the internet doesn't necessarily have to be based on images and written text. like, wouldn't it be neat to have a whole big part of the internet that was just made of sound? and maybe some kind of special sound-based interface to navigate it with? it could be a collaboratively-created sound world that we move around in and contribute to. i feel like this site doesn't really embody all of the potential of the idea, but i do have the sense that i'm reaching toward something beautiful. it's my hope that by putting it out there, this site might be helpful in bringing us a little closer to that place.</p>

<p>this is version 1.0, created june / july 2018</p>
