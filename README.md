# audio-webpage-template

The purpose of this project is to create and maintain and an easy-to-use template for creating audio-based websites.

The relevant files are:

about.html - about page

default.html - landing page

sun_castle.html - main part of site

Right now the files are strict copies of the protoype site at http://www.futureforever.net/sun_castle. 

I will be generalizing these shortly into more of a template format.

I use the <a href="https://github.com/richtr/NoSleep.js">nosleep.js</a> library by Rich Tibbetts to keep the screen from locking on mobile, which breaks me little app. Thanks Rich!
