# audio-webpage-template

The purpose of this project is to create and maintain and an easy-to-use template for creating audio-based websites.

The relevant files are:

default.html - landing page

sun_castle.html - main part of site

about.html - about page

Right now the files are strict copies of the protoype site at http://www.futureforever.net/sun_castle. 

I will be generalizing these shortly into more of a template format.

I use the nosleep.js library by Rich Tibbetts to keep the enable wake lock on the mobile version, otherwise screen lock breaks it.
